### Cslim

This is a prototype of Cslim, which extracts extracts programmer-specified
functions from a source package and generates new source files for a target
package, thereby enabling the reuse of systems software in resource-poor
execution environments, such as the IoT devices.

This was presented in ICDCN 2019:
